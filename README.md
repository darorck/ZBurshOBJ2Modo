# ZBurshOBJ2Modo
A Script to open ZBrush custom OBJ files with vertex colors in MODO 901+
It is my first Modo plugin so I have still much to improve. It is working with Python TD hope it helps you. All comments are welcome.

Instalation:
Just copy it in ..AppData\Roaming\Luxology\Scripts

Usage:
Open the OBJ as usual with modo, then run the script and select the OBJ file. You can see the new vertex map in the Vertex Map List -> Other maps.

```sh
@ImportZObj.py
```
