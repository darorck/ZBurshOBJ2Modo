# ZBurshOBJ2Modo
A Script to open ZBrush custom OBJ files with vertex colors in MODO 901+
It is my first Modo plugin so I have still much to improve. It is working with Python TD hope it helps you. All comments are welcome.

Just copy it in ..AppData\Roaming\Luxology\Scripts and run it in the command panel.
```sh
@ImportZObj.py
```
